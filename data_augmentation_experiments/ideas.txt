 Abstractive Multi-Document Summarization via Phrase Selection and Merging 
    To find coreference NPs (different mentions for the same entity), we first conduct coreference res-olution for each document with Stanford corefer-ence  resolution  package  (Lee  et  al.,  2013).   We adopt those resolution rules that are able to achieve high quality and address our need for summariza-tion.  In particular, Sieve 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, and 10 in the package are used.  A set of clusters are obtained and each cluster contains the mentions that refer to the same entity in a document.  The clusters  from  different  documents  in  the  same  topic are merged by matching the named entities. After merging, the mentions that are not NPs extracted in the phrase extraction step are removed in each cluster.   Two  NPs  in  the  same  cluster  are  determined as alternative of each other.

    To  find  alternative  VPs,  Jaccard  Index  is  em-ployed  as  the  similarity  measure.    Specifically, each VP is represented as a set of its concepts and the index value is calculated for each pair of VPs. If the value is larger than a threshold, the two VPsare determined as alternative of each other.
